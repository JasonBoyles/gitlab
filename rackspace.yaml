  Single Linux server running [GitLab](http://gitlab.org/) with a
  [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) back end.

  #### Getting Started
  [GitLab](http://gitlab.org/gitlab-ce/) is an open source, web based
  application that enables users to collaborate on code.

  #### Accessing Your Deployment
  To access your GitLab deployment, take the IP of the GitLab server and plug
  it in your browser. By default it will redirect you to https and you'll get a
  warning since a self signed certificate is installed.

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH.  We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X
  and Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).

  #### Details of Your Setup
  This deployment was stood up using
  [chef-solo](http://docs.opscode.com/chef_solo.html). Once the deployment is
  up, chef will not run again, so it is safe to modify configurations.

  Mail delivery is set to be handled by [Postfix](http://www.postfix.org/). If
  you are a Managed Cloud customer, Postfix has been re-configured to work with
  [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com/).

  GitLab itself has been installed into '/srv/git/gitlab'.  GitLab itself is a
  rails application. GitLab also has it's own version of Ruby that has been
  installed. You will find both the ruby and gem binaries in '/srv/git/bin/'.
  We recommend that all management actions related to gems and other ruby
  packages be performed as the 'git' user.

  A system user named 'git' has been created with a home of /srv/git. This is
  the user used for all services associated directly with GitLab.

  [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) has been compiled from source and can
  be found installed in '/srv/git'. By default, only the 'git' user will have
  '/srv/git' in it's $PATH. We recommend running all gem commands as the 'git'
  user to avoid any potential permission issues.

  [Redis](http://redis.io/) is installed and required for running GitLab. The
  configuration can be found in the '/etc/redis' directory.

  [Nginx](http://nginx.org/en/) is installed as the web server for this
  deployment. There are two sites configured, one to redirect all port 80
  traffic to port 443, and the other to manage connections to Unicorn. Both
  site configurations can be found in '/etc/nginx/sites-available' and are
  named 'gitlab' and 'http_redirect' respectively. Any changes to the site
  configurations will require a restart of the Nginx service.

  The self signed SSL certificate and private key used in can be found in
  '/etc/nginx/ssl/'. If you replace the key and cert with your own, please make
  sure to restart the nginx serice.

  [Unicorn](http://unicorn.bogomips.org/) is a Rack HTTP server installed to
  serve GitLab requests. All requests are proxied through Nginx. The unicorn
  configuration can be found in '/srv/git/gitlab/config/unicorn.rb'. Any
  changes will require a restart of unicorn. Unicorn is managed through the
  'gitlab' service, by restarting the gitlab service, it will restart both
  Unicorn and Sidekiq.

  [Sidekiq](http://sidekiq.org/) is running as a worker process.  Sidekiq works
  directly with the redis service installed. The configuration is located at
  '/srv/git/gitlab/config/initializers/4_sidekiq.rb'. This service is managed
  with the gitlab service like Unicorn.

  [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) is installed locally. The MySQL root password
  is provided in the passwords/secrets section of this deployment. We've added
  '/root/.my.cnf' to your system to make management of MySQL easier. This
  contains your root password as well in case you forget or lose your MySQL
  root password.
